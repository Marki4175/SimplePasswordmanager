# SimplePasswordmanager
Simple password manager which uses AES encryption. Written in xaml


Hi everyone, I want to share with you a password manager that I have created in XAML as a project for school. It is a simple but useful tool that allows you to store and manage your passwords for different websites and applications. You can also export and import your accounts via txt file, so you can backup or transfer your data easily. The password manager uses AES encryption and decryption to protect your information from unauthorized access. This is a project for personal use only, so please do not use it for sensitive or critical purposes. I hope you enjoy it and find it helpful.
